Maintained by [DBmaoha](https://github.com/DBmaoha), for saving own server using(and modified) mods.

It's a bad idea to store all your mods in this repo, my purpose is to make our modified changes easier to find. 

If there's a need I can cut off this repository, please [Sending Issues](https://github.com/xiaobbuguai/sws_WIP/issues) to let me know.
